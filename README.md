# Weather-Application-using-OpenWeatherMap-API
I designed a weather application using OpenWeatherMap API. The application is basically web application designed in Python language and I used Django Framework as backend. The web application is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The python code basically calls the API of OpenWeatherMap and the output is stored in a sqlite database. On running the code the web application gets opened in a web browser and we can enter any city in the search bar to check the weather conditions of that city. 

Everytime we search the city all the details of that city get stored in the sqlite database which can be retrieved using queries.
